                <p>When I was younger I was almost consumed by anger. My father had abandoned me before I was born, leaving
                    me with powerful feelings of worthlessness. Self-destruction defined my young adulthood. I thought being
                    tough and violent was the only way to be a man, but I was also scared of violence and sought escape in
                    reading and the natural world. While teaching in North Carolina this April, in the early days of the
                    Trump administration, reading the Buddhist poet, teacher and activist Thich Nhat Hanh got me thinking
                    again about false and true heroes – and the kinds of masculine heroes promoted as models in western culture.
