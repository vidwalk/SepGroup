It comprises all of the usual elements of traditional Hatha Yoga including: centring via breath awareness, postures/stretching (asanas), breathing practices (pranayama), sound practices (mantra) and guided relaxation (often in the form of Yoga Nidra). Some of the class will be in a flowing, dynamic style.</td>
