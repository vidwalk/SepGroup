                    <p>When I was younger I was almost consumed by anger. My father had abandoned me before I was born, leaving
                        me with powerful feelings of worthlessness. Self-destruction defined my young adulthood. I thought
                        being tough and violent was the only way to be a man, but I was also scared of violence and sought
                        escape in reading and the natural world. While teaching in North Carolina this April, in the early
                        days of the Trump administration, reading the Buddhist poet, teacher and activist Thich Nhat Hanh
                        got me thinking again about false and true heroes – and the kinds of masculine heroes promoted as
                        models in western culture.

                    <p>Buddhist teacher Mushim Patricia Ikeda has what she thinks is a great new way for Buddhists to be of
                        service — by getting their various communities to offer a simple item that helps them assert their
                        rights and feel less vulnerable.
